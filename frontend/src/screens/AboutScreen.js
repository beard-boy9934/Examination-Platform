              OnVarg is an online examination system where someone can conduct
              examination for other. Recently, some institutions have used
              Google classroom to conduct online evaluation of the subjects .
              However, the approach barely worked. Google Classroom could
              accommodate assignments, but using it for online exams was a
              strenuous task. It resulted in an inefficient examination process.
              In addition to it, there was a considerable scope given to the
              students to indulge in unfair means. Hence, it will be beneficial
              to develop a safe and secure system to conduct various exams such
              as lab exams, quizzes, and other exams that support questions of
              multiple-choice.
